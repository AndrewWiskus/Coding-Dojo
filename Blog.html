            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a 33 year old from California currently residing in Minneapolis, Mn. I'm married to a wonderful woman and have 3 kids (my greatest creations to date). I love art and culture, interesting people, and creating cool stuff. I am currently an aircraft mechanic who heads up the special projects department and In spend my days rebuilding vintage and one of a kind aircraft. When I am not at work I enjoy building whatever I feel like. I am excited to be adding a new skill into my toolbox with coding! </p>

            <p>I have had the opportunity to build some amazing aircraft in my position as head of special projects. However, none were as incredible as the very first airplane I ever built. I was fortunate enough to be one of the head builders on this Waco Biplane. The build took one year to complete and is one of the most unique aircraft to ever fly.  It is built on a 1939 Waco frame with a 450 horespower radial engine as well as a jet engine mounted to the belly of the airplane. We were commissioned by Jack Links to make something truly special and I believe we delivered.</p>

            <p>This is where I get to make whatever I feel like and it is truly my favorite thing to do. I paint paintings and build furniture. I make art out of old worthless objects. I restore old stuff and make inviting spaces for conversation. Above are some photos of different projects around my house.</p>
